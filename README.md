#  Brain Tumor Detection with Deep Learning (Object Detection)

This project focuses on detecting brain tumors in MRI images using deep learning-based **object detection** techniques. The model processes brain scan images and **locates tumors by drawing bounding boxes** around them.

##  Files

- `brainDetect.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing image preprocessing, model training, and tumor detection visualization.
- `brain_tumor_dataset.zip`: The dataset used for detection training/testing (includes labeled MRI scans).

##  Dataset

The dataset consists of brain MRI images annotated with tumor locations (e.g., bounding boxes). It is provided as `brain_tumor_dataset.zip`. Unzip it before using.

##  Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
